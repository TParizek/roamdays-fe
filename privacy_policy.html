    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

    <p>Roamdays ("the App") is built with privacy as a core principle. This policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Roamdays does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. We do not use analytics, tracking, or any third-party services. There are no user accounts.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All travel records you create are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it using the CSV export feature.</p>

    <h2>Location Data</h2>
    <p>If you grant location permission, the App uses Apple's significant location change monitoring to detect which country you are in. This processing happens entirely on your device. Location data is not sent to any server. You can disable location access at any time in your device Settings, and the App will continue to work with manual entry.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>If you grant notification permission, the App may send local notifications when a new country is detected. These notifications are generated on your device and do not involve any external service.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Apple's privacy policy governs these transactions.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all your travel records at any time from the Settings screen within the App. Uninstalling the App will also remove all stored data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any information from children. Since no data is collected from any user, this applies universally.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we update this privacy policy, we will post the revised version on this page with an updated date.</p>
